- **World Boundaries**: Invisible walls preventing player from leaving
- **Environmental Objects**: Lumbridge Castle, forest trees, water features
- **Shadow System**: Realistic shadows for depth and atmosphere

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- No additional dependencies (Three.js loaded via CDN)

### Running the Game

#### Option 1: Local Server (Recommended)
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then open your browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8000`

#### Option 2: Direct File Opening
Simply open `index.html` in your web browser (some features may not work due to CORS restrictions)

## 🎮 How to Play

### Basic Movement
1. **Left-click** anywhere on the ground to move your character
2. The player will automatically pathfind around obstacles
3. Watch the minimap to track your position in the world

### Camera Controls
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out (30% to 300% zoom range)
- **Camera Following**: Automatically follows player movement
- **Isometric View**: Fixed south-facing isometric perspective

### Advanced Features
- **Obstacle Avoidance**: Click anywhere - the system finds the best path
- **Smooth Animation**: Character walks with realistic arm/leg synchronization
- **Collision Detection**: Cannot walk through buildings or trees
- **World Boundaries**: Invisible walls keep you within the game world

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

### Core Systems
- **Three.js Rendering**: WebGL-based 3D graphics engine
- **Orthographic Camera**: Isometric projection for classic RPG feel
- **Raycasting**: Precise click-to-world position conversion
- **Pathfinding Algorithm**: A* inspired obstacle avoidance
- **Animation System**: Frame-rate independent character animation

### World Generation
- **Procedural Terrain**: Brown ground plane with optional height variation
- **Object Placement**: Buildings, trees, and water features
- **Collision System**: Rectangular and circular collision detection
- **Boundary Management**: World edge collision and visual feedback

### Performance Features
- **Efficient Rendering**: Optimized mesh instancing and material reuse
- **Shadow Mapping**: PCF soft shadows for realistic lighting
- **LOD System**: Distance-based detail reduction (planned)
- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch controls and responsive design
